    <p>Giving them a safe platform to share their experiences with police brutality and racism, in an effort to demonstrate that through listening and understanding, can heal together from the systemic violence that is inflicted on our communities.</p>

    <h2>Art Gallery</h2>
    <h3>June 27th, 2020</h3>
    <p>On June 27th, we showcased the amazing photography gallery of Spidey Guster telling the story of what it is like to live as a Black man in the US. Here we highlighted the fact that storytelling has many forms and all are critically important in the fight against police brutality and for social justice.
Along with the gallery we had some amazing key speakers and premiered a short documentary “All Ears” by Rachel Peltzer. A mini documentary following the words of Louis Guster, Spidey Guster’s father and former Black Panther and Vietnam war veteran who grew up during the civil rights movement of the 60’s.</p>

    <h2>Financial Freedom Workshop</h2>
    <h3>July 18th, 2020</h3>
	   <p>This event was geared towards POC and taking control over our financial health, wealth and future. With Award Winning author and speaker Genein Letford we hosted a webinar for our community to join and learn the importance of a basic understanding of financial tools, strategies and health.</p>
     <p>As we continue to fight for social justice and change we must realize that it expands beyond legislation and representation. POC and LGBT communities need to understand and reclaim the importance of the power of economic health so that they can begin to take agency of their financial story and future.</p>
